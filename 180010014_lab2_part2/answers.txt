Comment on the order in which processes are created and processes exit and justify it is as
expected:

Processes occur according to their dependencies. They can be any of these following states at a time:

NEW- The process is being created.
READY- The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
RUNNING- Instructions are being executed.
WAITING- The process is waiting for some event to occur(such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
TERMINATED- The process has finished execution.
